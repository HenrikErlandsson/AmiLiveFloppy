# AmiLiveFloppy
A community-driven project for a small standard platform supporting live floppies for bootable programs on all Amigas.

# Utilities planned
- A utility/antivirus bootblock: <strong><a href="https://github.com/HenrikErlandsson/SpaceBoot">SpaceBoot</a>. (Available.)
- A command-line program to adjust CPU and RAM settings.
- A file browser which allows navigating folders and files, view text files, start programs, and adjust visual preferences for presentation.
- A separate file browser which allows creating, copying, renaming, deleting, and setting the flags of files, relabeling floppy disks, and editing files in text and hexadecimal, with a monitor function.

# Release
The GitHub release will take the form of a live floppy image containing the bootblock and the utility programs.
