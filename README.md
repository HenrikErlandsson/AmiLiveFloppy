# AmiLiveFloppy
A community-driven project for a small standard platform supporting live floppies for bootable programs on all Amigas.

Utilities planned are:
- A utility/antivirus bootblock (SpaceBoot repo). Available.
- A command-line program to adjust CPU and RAM settings.
- A file browser which allows navigating folders and files, view text files, start programs, and adjust visual preferences for presentation.
- A separate file browser which allows creating, copying, renaming, and deleting files, editing files in text and hexadecimal, with a monitor function.
