# AmiLiveFloppy
A community-driven project for a small standard platform supporting live floppies for bootable programs on all Amigas.

# Utilities planned
- A utility/antivirus bootblock: <strong><a href="https://github.com/HenrikErlandsson/SpaceBoot">SpaceBoot</a>.
- <strong><a href="https://github.com/HenrikErlandsson/HogFast">HogFast</a>, a command-line program to adjust CPU and RAM settings.
- A file browser which allows navigating folders and files, view text files, start programs, and adjust visual preferences for presentation. (In progress.)
- A separate file browser which allows creating, copying, renaming, deleting, and setting the flags of files, relabeling floppy disks, and editing files in text and hexadecimal, with a monitor function. (Planned.)

# Release
The GitHub release will be a live floppy image containing the bootblock and the utility programs.
